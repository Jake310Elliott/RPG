# RPG
Pygame RPG that allows you to add whatever you want!

Play the game by running RPG.py

The game is built and run by RPG.py. The other files in this project are used as building blocks to create the virtual space such as
Characters, items, and animations. The idea is that these components can be used in combination to create any scene you'd like! Every level
Will be just like RPG.py but with the respective title and components to make it seem as though you haven't changed files at all. In this 
sense, every new level will be a new game but they should be used together and coherently so that the illusion is not broken
